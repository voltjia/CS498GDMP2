# Design Document

## New Machanic

The new mechanic is shooting projectiles. The player can shoot a projectile by pressing "F" key. If you successfully shoot the head of an enemy, then it will be destroyed.

## My Own Enemy

My own enemy is a Backstab, which teleports to the back of the player every 3 seconds and then chase the player. The instructions asked us to create an enemy of our own to be distinct and take on a different role. I have already implemented the Pursuer and the Flyer, which are in charge of melee and ranged combat. However, players may choose to run away from the Pursuers and dodge the projectiles from the Flyers. Therefore, I added such a Backstab to increase the difficulty of the game so that the player cannot always go back.

## Level Design

"Choose the right path!" is the core design philosophy of my game. Starting the game, there are actually two paths made of pickups in front of the player. We may choose the "right" path (path to the right) to reach the mountain room in front of us intuitively. However, even if you succeed passing all the enemies and arrive at that room. You may notice that it is actually a trap, where 4 Pursuers are waiting for you. The ultimate end goal we are looking for is actually floating under the mountain, so if we choose the left path (the real "right" path) and jump, we may find the path continues with floating pickups. If we fly following the floating path, we may then avoid all the combat and reach the goal peacefully.

## Meaning

I try to make this very simple game meaningful. Just like in our lives, we may from time to time encounter difficulties that we thought could not be solved. But often at this time, if we can think about the problem from a different angle, maybe this problem will be solved easily. This game is designed to educate players not to dig too deep, but to be flexible.
